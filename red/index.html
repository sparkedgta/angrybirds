Leader of the Pack
Red's special skills are his leadership qualities, which at first seems feeble compared to the brute force of Terence or explosive power of Bomb. But wait! Someone has to organize this odd flock of birds! Hes also a bit highly strung and sees small things as a declaration of war -- like hearing the sound of the wind and thinking its the battle cry of the pig army. So thats kind of intense!

Calm down, bird!
The whole flock tries to keep Red calm and relaxed by telling him to follow a strict program of herbal tea, soothing bath salts and deep-breathing exercises. But this only takes the edge off his anger, and it really doesn't take much to remind Red of those little pigs trying to get their dirty trotters on the eggs. Even the sight of something green can enrage him!

Wax on, wax off
Red always needs to keep his possessions in the best possible condition. Like a proud dad, he spends hours every morning waxing the slingshot and making sure the band is perfectly elasticated. But if a dirty leaf lands on the sling then his eye starts twitching to show he's edging closer to boiling point. Now he has to re-apply several more coats of polish to make it perfect again!

Egg-Stra Sensitive
Red also lets his guard down when he's alone with the eggs and can be seen softly stroking their shells and telling them bedtime stories. It's another rare moment of sensitivity and it reveals something of a softer side in him. But when the other flock members come a knocking, something clicks inside and instantly he's back to being his usual serious and alert self. Want to see Stella in action?
