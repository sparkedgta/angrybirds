Friendly and Fierce
Stella's the star of the show and the bird all the others look up to. She may look cute and cuddly, but don't be fooled -- if you push her too far, she'll soon reveal her blazing-hot temper! That's just how she rolls, sweet on the outside and fierce on the inside.

Fearless Adventurer
She's a keen adventurer and is always on the look out for fun, which means she can get bored and grumpy if there's nothing to do. She's also extremely ambitious, and loves taking on tough challenges -- but this means she sometimes bites off more than she can chew...

An Awesome member of the Flock
Stella first joined the Flock in Angry Birds' Back to School. She then joins the rest of the Flock to stop those mean-bully-pigs from 	stealing the eggs. She later helps them recover the eggs in Haunted Hogs and Winter Wonderham.

New Adventures
Stella has teamed up with Dahlia, Poppy, Willow and Luca. These fearless pals have a strong bond but even stronger personalities. You could even say they're best friends forever... most of the time. Want to see Stella in action? Click  here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMzYi1RrRfs
