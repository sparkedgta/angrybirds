Life in the Fast Lane
Chuck likes to do everything at 100 miles-per-hour. Why do things slowly and properly when you can do them quickly and carelessly? So he does the dishes in half the time, but with only half the dishes unbroken! And sleep? That just gets in the way of doing stuff. Each night he falls asleep accidentally after tiring himself out too much. I'm not tired I'm not tired ZZZZZZZZZZ.

Quick as Lightning
Ok, it's time to speed things up! Chuck's special power is a lightning-fast aerial assault that lets him dart toward the pigs at incredible speed! It's pretty awesome to see him in action as he soars through the skies and smashes through the piggy defenses. Watch out you little green creatures -- this incoming missile attack is super-accurate and crazy-fast!

Scatterbrain
Chuck has 100s of random thoughts a minute, making it hard for him to focus on a single thing. One moment he's 100% committed to a group activity, and the next he's off on his own adventure completely forgetting what he just agreed to! He gets bored really easily, so every day it's a new hobby: surfing, painting, karate, origami and many more. Just pick one and stick with it, bird!

Peacock of the Flock
This is the ultimate bird poser who loves spending time admiring his feathers in the mirror. He's such a show-off who likes to think the "duck face" internet meme was named after him! Chuck seems confident, but inside there's also a frightened little birdie who's scared of many things. Not exactly the image he wants of an extra tough and fearless action hero ready to take on the world! Want to see Chuck in action? Click here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZOwEfqfFKE
